<h2>SSH Honeypot</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
This project implements a simple SSH honeypot in Python. A honeypot is a security mechanism designed to detect, deflect, or counteract attempts at unauthorized use of information systems. In the context of SSH, a honeypot can be used to attract and monitor malicious actors attempting to gain unauthorized access to a system.  

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
Python 3.x  
Paramiko library (pip install paramiko)  


<h3>Notes </h3>   
This project is implemented as part of a college project to explore cybersecurity concepts.
Use caution when deploying the SSH honeypot in a production environment. Ensure proper security measures are in place to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive systems.
The SSH honeypot is for educational purposes only and should not be used for malicious activities.
