<h2>SSH Honeypot</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
This project implements a simple SSH honeypot in Python. A honeypot is a security mechanism designed to detect, deflect, or counteract attempts at unauthorized use of information systems. In the context of SSH, a honeypot can be used to attract and monitor malicious actors attempting to gain unauthorized access to a system.  

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
Python 3  <br />
Paramiko library (pip install paramiko)  

<h3>Features planned to add in future</h3>
- Fake File Directory system <br />
- Interactive Web Interface <br />
- Alerting Mechanism <br />


<h3>Notes </h3>   
- This project is implemented as part of a college project to explore cybersecurity concepts. <br />
- Use caution when deploying the SSH honeypot in a production environment. Ensure proper security measures are in place to prevent unauthorized access to   
 sensitive systems. <br />
- The SSH honeypot is for educational purposes only and should not be used for malicious activities.<br /> 
- RSA key will change evreytime u use this so go to user>username>.ssh>know_host and delete all the RSA keys there <br />
